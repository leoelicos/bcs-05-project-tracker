## Introduction

[Project Tracker](https://leoelicos.github.io/bcs-05-project-tracker/) allows the user to input a Project and be able to see the input in a table, which also generates a column for expected earnings for the project. There is a delete button which allows the user to delete a project.

The app uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) to render the HTML, as well as [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) to traverse and manipulate the DOM. The form uses [jQuery UI Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)

I made this app to learn about `Bootstrap`, `jQuery`, event delegation as well as HTML `<table>`.

## Usage

1. Open [Project Tracker](https://leoelicos.github.io/bcs-05-project-tracker/) in a web browser.

6. Select a Due Date from the Calendar Widget

7. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click `Submit Project Info`
